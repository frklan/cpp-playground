# nanogui

Testing the [nanogui](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui) library.

Unfortunatley the build system spits out about a billion warnings and it's pretty heavy to build so I'll keep it as a separate branch for now.

## Compiling

As usual, cmake is set up to automatically include the project. The full nanogui dependency tree will be fetched when we run cmake.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ...
make nano
```

As per the nanogui documentation, the libraray could also be added as a submodule and trhe CMakeList.txt edited like so

```Makefile
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12 FATAL_ERROR)

project(nano)

set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set (CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

file(GLOB SOURCE_FILES *.cpp)
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})

#add_subdirectory(${PROJECT_NAME}_lib)
#target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${PROJECT_NAME}_lib)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC version)

# nanogui
include(cmake/nanogui.cmake)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${NANOGUI_EXTRA_LIBS} nanogui)

## nanogui as submodule
add_compile_options(-Wno-everything)
## Disable building extras we won't need (pure C++ project)
set(NANOGUI_BUILD_EXAMPLE OFF CACHE BOOL " " FORCE)
set(NANOGUI_BUILD_PYTHON OFF CACHE BOOL " " FORCE)
set(NANOGUI_INSTALL OFF CACHE BOOL " " FORCE)

# Add the configurations from nanogui
add_subdirectory(ext/nanogui)

# For reliability of parallel build, make the NanoGUI targets dependencies
set_property(TARGET glfw glfw_objects nanogui PROPERTY FOLDER "dependencies")

# Various preprocessor definitions have been generated by NanoGUI
add_definitions(${NANOGUI_EXTRA_DEFS})

# On top of adding the path to nanogui/include, you may need extras
include_directories(${NANOGUI_EXTRA_INCS})
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ext/nanogui/include)

# Lastly, additional libraries may have been built for you.  In addition to linking
# against NanoGUI, we need to link against those as well.
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${NANOGUI_EXTRA_LIBS} nanogui)

```

I guess it would be best to compile it as a system library and be done with it..
